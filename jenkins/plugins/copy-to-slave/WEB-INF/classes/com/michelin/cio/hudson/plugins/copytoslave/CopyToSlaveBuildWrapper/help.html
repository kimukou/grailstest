<div>
    Copies a set of files located somewhere on the master node (cf. the <b>Paths
    are relative to</b> field) into the workspace of the corresponding job on
    the node performing the build (whether it is a slave node or the master
    node itself).<br/>
    This is useful, for example, when some files required for the build to take
    place are not present in the SCM, but are located in one of the three
    following locations: <code>HUDSON_HOME/userContent</code>, <code>HUDSON_HOME</code>,
    or directly in the project's <a href='ws/'>workspace</a> (on the
    master node).
