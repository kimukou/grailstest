<div>
    Specify the base location for the paths that are specified in the <strong>
    Includes</strong> and <strong>Excludes</strong> fields:
    <ul>
    <li>The <code>HUDSON_HOME/userContent</code> option should be preferred
    since it is the standard folder used by Hudson/Jenkins to expose files to
    users.</li>
    <li>Using <code>HUDSON_HOME</code> is not advised since it exposes the
    whole Hudson/Jenkins folder.</li>
    <li>Using the job's <a href="ws/">workspace</a> is not advised since it
    requires manually creating it before running a first build.</li>
    </ul>
