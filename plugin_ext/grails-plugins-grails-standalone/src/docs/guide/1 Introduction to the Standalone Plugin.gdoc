The Standalone plugin builds a runnable JAR file with an embedded war built from your application and an embedded Tomcat 7 instance. This allows you to build a single archive that can be run on any computer with Java 5 or higher by running @java -jar standalone.jar@. This can be convenient for demos or even very lightweight installs of low-traffic Grails applications.
