/**
 * Implementation of {@link AtmosphereHandler} allows creation of
 * event-driven web applications which are hosted in the browser.
 * An {@link AtmosphereHandler} allows a web application to suspend and resume
 * an http response. An http response can be suspended {@link AtmosphereResource#suspend()}
 * and later resume via {@link  AtmosphereResource#resume()}. Messages can also
 * be shared between suspended response and their associated {@link AtmosphereHandler}
 * using a {@link Broadcaster}. Any invocation of {@link Broadcaster#broadcast(java.lang.Object)}
 * will allow a suspended response to write the content of the message
 * {@link AtmosphereHandler#onStateChange(org.atmosphere.cpr.AtmosphereResourceEvent)}.
 * <p/>
 * <striong>A class implementing {@link AtmosphereHandler} must be thread safe</strong>
 * <p/>
 * For example, a simple Chat based AtmosphereHandler will take the form of
 * <p/>
 * <p><pre><code>
 * <p/>
 * public AtmosphereResource&lt;HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse&gt;
 * onRequest(AtmosphereResource&lt;HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse&gt; event) throws IOException {
 * HttpServletRequest req = event.getRequest();
 * HttpServletResponse res = event.getResponse();
 * <p/>
 * res.setContentType("text/html");
 * res.addHeader("Cache-Control", "private");
 * res.addHeader("Pragma", "no-cache");
 * if (req.getMethod().equalsIgnoreCase("GET")) {
 * event.suspend();
 * } else if (req.getMethod().equalsIgnoreCase("POST")) {
 * res.setCharacterEncoding("UTF-8");
 * String action = req.getParameterValues("action")[0];
 * String name = req.getParameterValues("name")[0];
 * <p/>
 * if ("login".equals(action)) {
 * event.getBroadcaster().broadcast(
 * BEGIN_SCRIPT_TAG + toJsonp("System Message from "
 * + event.getWebServerName(), name + " has joined.") + END_SCRIPT_TAG);
 * res.getWriter().write("success");
 * res.getWriter().flush();
 * } else if ("post".equals(action)) {
 * String message = req.getParameterValues("message")[0];
 * event.getBroadcaster().broadcast(BEGIN_SCRIPT_TAG + toJsonp(name, message) + END_SCRIPT_TAG);
